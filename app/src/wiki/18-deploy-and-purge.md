title: Deploy and purge
group: Getting started
summary: What happens when you deploy, what a purge removes, and why Obsidian sometimes refuses.

## Deploy

Deploy puts the enabled mods of the active profile into the game. The button turns green when you have changes that are not in the game yet. The game has to be closed.

Each deploy runs these steps:

1. Check that the game is the build Obsidian knows (see below).
2. Back up your save folder, when it changed since the last backup. The first backup and the 9 newest are kept, so your save from before any mod stays.
3. Work out which mod wins each resource, following the load order.
4. Compile the Lua of every mod, and the loader, into code the game can run.
5. Write one patch per game bundle, and the list of deployed mods for the loader.

**Play** deploys first when changes are waiting, then starts the game.

## Purge

Purge deletes every file Obsidian wrote and checks that none is left. The game is then the vanilla game again. Your library and profiles stay; deploy again to bring the mods back.

> [!NOTE]
> Patches that another tool or a person put in the game folder are listed under Game in [Settings](app:settings) and never deleted. The patches Obsidian writes go above them.

> [!WARNING]
> Purge before you uninstall Obsidian. The patches stay in the game folder until something removes them, so the game would keep running your mods.

## The build check

Obsidian only deploys to the Steam build of HELLDIVERS it was tested on. If the game files differ, deploy stops and the bar at the top says the build is unknown. The loader checks again every time the game starts and keeps every mod off on a build it doesn't know.

HD1 hasn't been updated since 2020, so this mostly catches game files changed by hand or by another mod tool. Verify the game files in Steam to fix it.

## Saves

Obsidian never edits your progress. While session content is in play it only clears the results waiting to upload, so they can't reach the Galactic War later. Session mods may change your own progress (XP, unlocks), and Obsidian doesn't undo that, which is why each deploy makes a backup first. The backups are in the `backups` folder in the app data folder.
