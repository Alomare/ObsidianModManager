title: What the guardrails can't do

summary: What Obsidian protects against, and what no mod manager can stop.
---

The guardrails stop well-behaved mods from harming other players by accident, and they make the safe setup the default one. They are not anti-cheat.

## What they cover

- A vanilla player doesn't find modded lobbies in matchmaking.
- Session mods that use the loader switch off by themselves in a lobby that didn't agree to them.
- Missions played with session content aren't reported to the Galactic War.
- A mod that keeps failing is switched off, and a crash at startup names the mod that was starting.

## What they can't cover

Everything runs on your own PC, so a person who wants to cheat can write a script that skips the loader entirely. No mod manager can prevent that.

A mod can also break the rules by mistake or on purpose:

- by calling itself a client mod while it changes the shared game;
- by changing game code directly, without the hooks of the loader, so the loader can't switch the change off.

When a mod starts, the loader compares the game before and after, and writes one line per mod to the loader log listing what the mod added or replaced outside the loader. That line is where to look when a mod behaves badly.

> [!TIP]
> Install mods from authors and places you trust, and read what a mod says it does. If a client mod changes things other players can see, report it to the author or on the Discord.
