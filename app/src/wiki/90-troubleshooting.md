## Back to vanilla first

When the game misbehaves, **Purge** takes every Obsidian file out of the game. If the problem stays after a purge, Obsidian isn't the cause; verify the game files in Steam.

## The game crashed

The loader writes a line just before it starts each mod. If the game stops at that moment, the next time you open Obsidian it names the mod that was starting. Turn that mod off, deploy, and tell the author.

If the game stops later, Obsidian tells you the game didn't close normally. A crash inside the game's engine usually leaves no error in the log, so try turning off the mods you added last, one at a time.

## A mod does nothing

- Check that the mod is on and that you deployed after turning it on. A green **Deploy** button means changes are waiting.
- For a session mod, check the lobby: with players who didn't agree, session mods switch off ([Playing online](wiki:multiplayer)).
- Read the logs (below). A mod that failed at startup has an error line there.

## "Build unknown"

The game files don't match the build Obsidian knows, so nothing gets deployed and the loader starts no mod. Purge, then verify the game files in Steam. If you used another mod tool that edits bundles directly, verifying puts the originals back.

## Logs

The logs are in `%APPDATA%\Arrowhead\Helldivers\ObsidianModManager\logs`:

| File | What it holds |
|---|---|
| `loader.log` | Each mod starting, hooks going in, the multiplayer state, and what each mod changed outside the loader |
| `<mod id>.log` | The lines that mod wrote with `obsidian.log`, and nothing else |

## Asking for help

Use **Copy report** in [Settings](app:settings), under Data. It copies your versions, the mods that are on and the end of `loader.log`, without your Windows account name. Paste it, with what happened, into the [Discord](https://dsc.gg/hd1modding) or a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/Alomare/ObsidianModManager/issues).
