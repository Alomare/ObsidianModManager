summary: Importing a mod from a .zip or a folder, updating one, and removing one.

## Importing

Drag a mod folder or a `.zip` file onto the mod list in the [Mods](app:mods) tab, or click the green **+** beside Create Folder and pick one. Several files can go in at once, and a notification says what happened to each one.

Obsidian copies the mod into the library, so you can delete the download afterwards. Importing changes nothing in the game until you deploy.

### Mods made for Obsidian

A mod made for Obsidian has an `obsidian.json` file at the top of the folder or archive. Obsidian reads the name, version, options and keys from that file, and the mod shows them in the panel on the right.

### Older mods

Most HD1 mods shared today replace whole game bundles, with files named like `9e13b2414b41b842`. Obsidian imports those as well. It compares each bundle in the mod with the one in your game and keeps only the resources the mod really changes, so two older mods that touch different things can now run together.

Older mods are imported with the **session** scope, because Obsidian can't tell what they change in a shared game ([Scopes](wiki:scopes)). They also can't be switched off in the middle of a mission.

A patch for another mod doesn't bring that mod with it. Import both and put the patch lower in the list. Check which version the patch was built for: the files the two share come from the patch, so a patch for an older version takes them back to that version.

> [!NOTE]
> To compare bundles, the game files have to be the original ones, so the import stops if they aren't. If you copied a mod into the game folder by hand, verify the game files in Steam and import it again.

## Updating

Import the new version the same way. A mod with the same id replaces the one in the library, and the notification shows the old and new version numbers. Your option values and keys stay, except for options the author changed the type of.

### From GitHub

A mod can name its GitHub repository. When one does, a button with two arrows appears on its row in the [Mods](app:mods) tab, between the switch and the name, and asks GitHub for a new version of that mod. The same button on a folder asks about every mod in that folder, and the one at the top of the list asks about them all. A mod that has a new version shows an **Update to** button beside its name. Click that, then deploy.

Obsidian asks GitHub when it starts and when you click, and it only offers a higher version of the same mod. Nothing installs until you choose to: use the tag on a mod, or **Update all** when several are waiting.

## Removing

Right-click a mod and choose **Remove**, or use the bin under the close button in the details of a mod. To remove several, check them and use **Remove** in the bar at the foot of the list.

## Obsidian Kit

Three mods come with Obsidian, in the **Obsidian Kit** folder at the top of the list: Obsidian API, [Obsidian Trainer](wiki:trainer) and Obsidian Quality of Life. Quality of Life starts on, with only the widescreen fixes enabled. The other two stay off until you turn them on.

They're mods like any other: you can turn them on or off, remove them and update them from GitHub. The folder starts locked, so it stays where it is. Click its padlock to unlock it, and then you can move the mods, or rename or delete the folder. To put everything back, use **Restore Obsidian Kit** in [Settings](app:settings). It brings back deleted mods and the folder, and resets their settings in the active profile.

## Dependencies

Some mods need others to work. The **Dependencies** tab, in the panel on the right, shows what a mod needs and which mods need it. Switching a mod on switches on what it needs, and switching it off switches off the mods that need it.

If a mod needs something that isn't in your library, the tab says so, and the mod won't switch on until you add it.

## Pictures

A mod can bring a square picture. To use your own, open the mod in the panel on the right and click the picture. Profiles take a picture the same way.
